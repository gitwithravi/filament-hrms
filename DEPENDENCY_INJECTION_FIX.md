# Dependency Injection Fix Summary

## Issue
After refactoring the `LeaveRequestService`, the application was throwing this error:
```
Too few arguments to function App\Services\LeaveRequestService::__construct(), 0 passed in 
/home/raviks/Development/filament-hrms/app/Filament/Resources/LeaveRequestResource/Fields/LeaveDetails.php 
on line 171 and exactly 4 expected
```

## Root Cause
The refactored `LeaveRequestService` now requires 4 dependencies through constructor injection:
- `WorkingDayService`
- `LeaveBalanceService`
- `LeaveOverlapService`
- `ConsecutiveLeaveValidationService`

But the existing code was still using direct instantiation: `new LeaveRequestService()`

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Service Registration in AppServiceProvider
Registered all services as singletons in `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`:

```php
/**
 * Register leave request related services
 */
private function registerLeaveRequestServices(): void
{
    $this->app->singleton(\App\Services\WorkingDayService::class);
    $this->app->singleton(\App\Services\LeaveBalanceService::class);
    $this->app->singleton(\App\Services\LeaveOverlapService::class);
    $this->app->singleton(\App\Services\ConsecutiveLeaveValidationService::class);
    $this->app->singleton(\App\Services\LeaveRequestService::class);
}
```

### 2. Updated Service Usage
Replaced all direct instantiations with Laravel's service container resolution:

#### Before:
```php
$leaveRequestService = new LeaveRequestService();
```

#### After:
```php
$leaveRequestService = app(LeaveRequestService::class);
```

### 3. Files Updated
The following files were updated to use proper dependency injection:

1. **app/Filament/Resources/LeaveRequestResource/Fields/LeaveDetails.php**
   - Line 91: Form validation (start_date rule)
   - Line 142: Form validation (end_date rule)  
   - Line 170: Leave balance information display

2. **app/Filament/Resources/LeaveRequestResource/Pages/CreateLeaveRequest.php**
   - Line 57: Leave request validation during creation

3. **app/Filament/Resources/LeaveRequestResource/Pages/EditLeaveRequest.php**
   - Line 32: Leave request validation during edit

### 4. Verification
Tested the service container resolution:
```bash
php artisan tinker --execute="dd(app('App\\Services\\LeaveRequestService'))"
```

Result shows proper dependency injection:
```
App\Services\LeaveRequestService^ {
  -workingDayService: App\Services\WorkingDayService^ {}
  -leaveBalanceService: App\Services\LeaveBalanceService^ {
    -workingDayService: App\Services\WorkingDayService^ {}
  }
  -leaveOverlapService: App\Services\LeaveOverlapService^ {}
  -consecutiveLeaveValidationService: App\Services\ConsecutiveLeaveValidationService^ {
    -workingDayService: App\Services\WorkingDayService^ {}
  }
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
Services are registered as singletons, ensuring single instances throughout the application lifecycle.

### 2. **Automatic Dependency Resolution**
Laravel's service container automatically resolves and injects dependencies.

### 3. **No Breaking Changes**
The public API of `LeaveRequestService` remains unchanged - only the instantiation method changed.

### 4. **Performance**
Singleton registration ensures services are instantiated only once and reused.

### 5. **Testability**
Services can now be easily mocked and swapped for testing by binding different implementations in the service container.

## Alternative Approaches

### Method Injection
Instead of using `app()` helper, services could be injected via method parameters in controller methods or form classes that support method injection.

### Constructor Injection in Classes
For classes that support constructor injection (like Controllers, Jobs, etc.), dependencies can be injected directly in the constructor.

## Conclusion
The dependency injection issue has been resolved by:
1. Properly registering services in the service container
2. Using Laravel's service resolution instead of direct instantiation
3. Maintaining backward compatibility with existing code

The refactored service architecture now works seamlessly with Laravel's dependency injection container.
