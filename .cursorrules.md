# CursorRules â€“ Model Conventions

This document outlines the standard conventions to be followed when creating Eloquent models in this project.

## ðŸ§± Model Structure Rules

1. **Universal Fields for All Models**
   - Every model **must include** the following attributes:
     - `id` (Primary Key, auto-incrementing)
     - `uuid` (Universally Unique Identifier)
     - Laravel's default timestamps:
       - `created_at`
       - `updated_at`

2. **Traits**
   - All models **must use the `HasUuid` trait** to ensure UUID functionality is automatically handled.
     ```php
     use App\Traits\HasUuid;

     class YourModel extends Model
     {
         use HasUuid;
     }
     ```

3. **Enums**
   - Any field requiring an enumeration of fixed values **must** use a dedicated **Enum class**.
     - Enum classes should be stored in a well-organized directory (e.g., `App\Enums`)
     - Always type-cast the enum in the model where it's used
     - Example:
       ```php
       protected $casts = [
           'status' => \App\Enums\StatusEnum::class,
       ];
       ```

Please ensure these conventions are followed across all modules to maintain consistency and facilitate code maintenance.
